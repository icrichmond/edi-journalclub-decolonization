## Canadian Context + Discomfort

![](discomfort.jpg){fig-align="center"}



## Today's Meeting

- [Decolonization is not a metaphor - Tuck & Yang (2012)](https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/18630/15554)
  - Settler Moves to Innocence (p. 9-28)

- Incredibly formative paper



## Motivation 

> One trend we have noticed, with growing apprehension, is the ease with
which the language of decolonization has been superficially adopted into education and other
social sciences, supplanting prior ways of talking about social justice, critical methodologies, or
approaches which decenter settler perspectives. (p. 2)

> ... decolonization is not accountable to settlers, or settler futurity. Decolonization is accountable to
Indigenous sovereignty and futurity. (p. 35)



## Key Take-Homes

> Decolonization is not a metaphor ... Decolonization doesn’t have a synonym. (p.3)

> ... **decolonization in the settler colonial context must involve the repatriation of land** simultaneous to the recognition of how land and relations to land have always already been differently understood and enacted; that is, all of the land... (p. 7, emphasis my own) 



## Settler-Colonialism 

- presented as a unique type of colonization that combines internal and external colonization and requires colonizers to **stay** 

- Canada is a settler-colonial nation-state and this is the foundation of our country 

> In order for the settlers to make a place their home, they must destroy and disappear the Indigenous peoples that live there. (p.6)



## Setter Moves to Innocence

> Settler moves to innocence are those strategies or positionings that attempt to relieve the settler of feelings of guilt or responsibility without giving up land or power or privilege, without having to change much at all. In fact, settler scholars may gain professional kudos or a boost in their reputations for being so sensitive or self-aware. (p. 10)


- we (settlers) are all benefiting from erasure and assimilation of Indigenous peoples 
  - causes discomfort, [white guilt](https://www-jstor-org.lib-ezproxy.concordia.ca/stable/41211829?seq=1), perhaps even [white tears](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0020174X.2019.1610048)



## I - Settler nativism

- "Indian-grandmother complex" 

- This is partly true (because of the violence of settler colonialism) - but not in the way that we want it to be

- Facilitates the "past" narrative of Indigenous peoples and upholds a settler future



## II - Fantasizing adoption

- I am a "good" white person, I am "accepted" by Indigenous communities

> the settler intellectual who hybridizes decolonial thought with Western critical traditions (metaphorizing decolonization), emerges superior to both Native intellectuals and continental theorists simultaneously. (p. 16)

> The beauty of this settler fantasy is that it adopts decolonization and aborts it in one gesture. (p. 17)



## III - Colonial equivocation

- Equating all liberation/social justice struggles with decolonization 

- We see this particularly in universities + teaching environments 

> ‘We are all colonized,’ may be a true statement but is deceptively embracive and
vague, its inference: ‘None of us are settlers.’ (p. 18)


## IV - Conscientization

> the front-loading of critical consciousness building can waylay decolonization, even though the experience of teaching and learning to be critical of settler colonialism can be so powerful it can feel like it is indeed making change. (p. 19)

- How is your work as an social-justice oriented educator/mentor/supervisor/researcher tied to real-world application and improvement?



## V - A(s)t(e)risk peoples

> Indigenous peoples are rendered visible in mainstream educational research in two main ways: as “at risk” peoples and as asterisk peoples. (p. 22)

> Urban land (indeed all land) is Native land. The vast majority of Native youth in North America live in urban settings. Any decolonizing urban education endeavor must address the foundations of urban land pedagogy
and Indigenous politics vis-a-vis the settler colonial state. (p. 23)


## VI - Re-occupation and urban homesteading

> Land (not money) is actually the basis for US wealth (p.24)

- This is true for Canada as well 

- The land we are on does not belong to us
  - A university and research program cannot "decolonize" while acquiring, possessing, and occupying property on stolen land




## Questions for you 

::: {.incremental}

- Did you identify with specific moves to innocence (or did you identify different ones)?

- Did your key points differ from mine? What resonated with you?

- How did this resonate with your research program? 

- How did this resonate with your teaching practices?

## Unsettling 

> We provide this (moves to innocence) framework so that we can be more impatient with each other, less likely to accept gestures and half-steps, and more willing to press for acts which unsettle innocence ... (p. 10)
