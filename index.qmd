## Canadian Context + Discomfort

![](discomfort.jpg){fig-align="center"}



## Today's Meeting

- [Decolonization is not a metaphor - Tuck & Yang (2012)](https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/18630/15554)
  - Settler Moves to Innocence (p. 9-28)

- Incredibly formative paper



## Motivation 

> One trend we have noticed, with growing apprehension, is the ease with
which the language of decolonization has been superficially adopted into education and other
social sciences, supplanting prior ways of talking about social justice, critical methodologies, or
approaches which decenter settler perspectives. (p. 2)

> ... decolonization is not accountable to settlers, or settler futurity. Decolonization is accountable to
Indigenous sovereignty and futurity. (p. 35)



## Key Take-Homes

> Decolonization is not a metaphor ... Decolonization doesnâ€™t have a synonym. (p.3)

> ... **decolonization in the settler colonial context must involve the repatriation of land** simultaneous to the recognition of how land and relations to land have always already been differently understood and enacted; that is, all of the land... (p. 7, emphasis my own) 



## Settler-Colonialism 

- presented as a unique type of colonization that combines internal and external colonization and requires colonizers to **stay** 

- Canada is a settler-colonial nation-state and this is the foundation of our country 

> In order for the settlers to make a place their home, they must destroy and disappear the Indigenous peoples that live there. (p.6)
